Star Schema Design Documentation
SECTION 1--> An Overview of Stars (The Star Schema)
In a star schema there is one fact table and three dimension tables to perform analysis of sales data.
Fact_Sales is the Fact Table; it contains the sales of individual products by order line item. Quantity_Sold, Unit_Price, Discount, and Total can be found in the Fact_Sales table, as well as foreign keys relating to the date dimension (dim_Date), product dimension (dim_Product), and customer dimEnsion (dim_Customer).

The dim_Date Dimension is a conformed Date Dimension and is intended for analysis of data based on the passage of time. In addition to the surrogate primary key (Date_Key), the dim_Date Dimension includes fields for Full_Date, Day_Of_Week, Month, Month_Name, Quarter, Year, and Is_Weekend.

The dim_Product Dimension includes descriptive attributes of products (Product_Key, Product_ID, Product_Name, Category_Subcategory_Brand_Standard_Price) to facilitate the Product Level analysis of sales.

The dim_Customer Dimension holds Customer Information (Customer_Key, Customer_ID, Customer_Name, Gender, City, State, Country, Customer_Segment, Date_of_Registration).
This Star Schema provides flexible and efficient methods for analysing sales data along the value chain, time, product, or customer.




SECTON 2--> Design Choices
The choice of granularity at the line-item level is due to it allowing the best level of detail for the sales data, as there is one record per product purchased on a given order. This enables complete and accurate analysis of how a product performed in terms of sales, pricing, discounts, and purchasing patterns of customers. The detailed data can also easily be aggregated to higher levels such as daily, monthly, or yearly aggregates of sales.

Instead of using natural keys, surrogate keys were implemented due to generated by the system itself and being immutable over time. An example of this is a customer ID or a product code, both of which can change or be duplicated across different source systems. Surrogate keys also increase the speed of querying the data, as well as assist with the management of slowly changing dimensions.

The star schema design provides for both drill-down and roll-up capability through the central fact table and its link to dimension tables. As a result, users can drill down to daily sales from yearly sales and roll up from product sales to category sales, thereby providing maximum flexibility and easy for analysis.



Section 3--> Sample Data Flow (3 marks)
1. The Source (The Receipt) You start with one line that has everything mixed together:Order #101: John Doe bought 2 Laptops for ₹50,000 each on Jan 15, 2024.
2. The Flow (The Split)To make this data useful, the system "shreds" the receipt and puts the details into different folders (Tables).
The Descriptions (Dimension Tables): * Date: Stores the "When" (Jan 15, Q1).
Customer: Stores the "Who" (John Doe, Mumbai).
Product: Stores the "What" (Laptop, Electronics).
The Numbers (Fact Table):This table acts as a summary. 
It doesn't use names; it uses ID numbers (Keys) to point to the folders above .
The Math: 2*(Quantity) * ₹50,000 (Price) = ₹100,000 (Total).
